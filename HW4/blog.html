		<h2 id="s1">From Desktop Apps to Web Apps: How the Digital World Has Changed</h2>
		<p>Remember, not so long ago, when you had to install software for everything? QuickBooks came in a box with a CD. Microsoft Word required installation. Banking meant driving to the bank.</p>
		<p>Today? QuickBooks Online is accessed through the internet. Microsoft Office, though still a slew of desktop applications, is moving towards the web-based Office 365. You can do most of your banking and even deposit a check in your web browser.</p>
		<p>The shift from desktop applications to web applications has been a significant technological change over the past three decades. According to Stack Overflow’s annual Developer Survey, web development languages now consistently rank as the most popular programming languages year after year. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS have dominated the top spots, with JavaScript being the most commonly used programming language for over a decade running.</p>
		<p>This isn’t just a tech trend. It’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology daily. And it’s precisely why web development can be such a valuable skill for your homeschool student who is interested in the field of technology.</p>
		<h2 id="s2">Why Start with Web Development?</h2>
		<h3>No Special Tools Required</h3>
		<p>Unlike other programming disciplines that require special software, compilers, or complex development environments, web development needs just two things, which you already have on your computer:</p>
		<p>A simple text editor (like Notepad)</p>
		<p>A web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)</p>
		<p>That’s it. Your homeschooler can start creating their first web page within minutes, with 0 hours of setup and installation required.</p>
		<h3>Quick Wins Keep Students Going</h3>
		<p>When students type a few lines of HTML, save the file, and open it in a web browser, they see their creation come to life immediately. Even better, web browsers are remarkably forgiving; if you forget a closing tag or make a small syntax error, the page still displays something rather than showing an error message or refusing to compile. This forgiving environment combined with instant visual feedback keeps students engaged and excited about learning, crucial for maintaining momentum in any homeschool subject.</p>
		<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
		<p>Every business needs a website. Every organization wants an online presence. By learning web development, your homeschooler isn’t just learning to code, they’re gaining skills they can use immediately to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a website for the family business</li>
			<li>Build an online presence for their parish youth group</li>
			<li>Design a blog to share their faith journey (like Blessed Carlo Acutis!)</li>
			<li>Develop web applications that solve real problems</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="s3">What Exactly Are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</h2>
		<p>Let me demystify these terms using something you already know: Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint slides.</p>
		<p><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is like the structure and content of a Word document. Just as you use headings, paragraphs, bulleted lists, and insert images in Word, HTML provides these same structural elements for web pages. It tells the browser “this is a heading,” “this is a paragraph,” “this is a list.”</p>
		<p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is like the formatting and styling in Word. You know how you can change fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment in Word? CSS does the same for web pages. It controls how everything looks: the colors, fonts, layouts, and even animations. If HTML is your document’s content, CSS is all the formatting that makes it visually appealing.</p>
		<p><b>JavaScript</b> is like the animations and transitions in PowerPoint. It adds interactivity and makes things happen. You know how in PowerPoint you can make text fly in, have slides transition with effects, or make things happen when you click? JavaScript does the same for web pages. It can respond to clicks, validate forms, create animations, and update content without reloading the page. This is actual programming, but students typically learn HTML and CSS first before tackling JavaScript.</p>
		<p>Worried about the math and complex logic involved in programming? I have good news for you: HTML and CSS require no math skills and no previous programming experience. JavaScript does involve more traditional programming concepts, but by the time students reach it, they’ll have built confidence from learning HTML and CSS.</p>
